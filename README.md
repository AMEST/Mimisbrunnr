## Get started

### Configuration

All configuration may be configured in `appsettings.json` or in Environment variables

#### Authentication

* `Openid:Authority` - openid authority (example: `https://accounts.google.com`)
* `Openid:ClientId` - client id in openid provider 
* `Openid:ClientSecret` - client secret in openid provider 
* `Openid:ResponseType` - oidc authentication response type (example: `code`)
* `Openid:Scope` - array with oidc scope requested when authenticate. By default in index 0,1,2 values ("openid","profile","email") 

#### Database

Mimisbrunnr use MongoDB as persistent data storage.

*  `Storage:ConnectionString` - mongo connection string (example: `mongodb://app:password@localhost/mimisbrunnr?authSource=admin`)

#### Caching

For better responsiveness of the service, caching is used. The service supports several caching modes:
1. In memory - suitable for working in only 1 copy, or for development. (DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS TYPE FOR 2 or more service instances)
2. In MongoDB - does not give a special performance boost, but allows you to cache aggregated data without making many queries each time (for example, the space page tree is quite hard to calculate)
3. In Redis - the most productive and recommended mode.

* `Caching:Type` - cache type (`Memory`, `MongoDb`, `Redis`)
* `Caching:RedisConnectionString` - connection string for Redis cache type

#### Persistent

There are several storage options for storing page attachments and other files: 
1. Local file system - only suitable for deployment in a single instance and not in a docker container
2. GridFS - storing files in MongoDB
3. WebDav - storing files in repositories with webdav interface

* `Persistent:Type` - storage type (`Local`, `GridFs`, `WebDav`)
* Local:
  * `Persistent:Local:Path` - Path in file system where stored files
* GridFs:
  * `Persistent:GridFs:ConnectionString` - MongoDb ConnectionString for gridfs store
* WebDav
  * `Persistent:WebDav:Address` - url to WebDav server (example: `http://nextcloud.local/remote.php/dav/files/sample-username/`)
  * `Persistent:WebDav:Username` - WebDav username
  * `Persistent:WebDav:Password` - WebDav password

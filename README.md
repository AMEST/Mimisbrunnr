## Description

MÃ­misbrunnr is the source of knowledge. A wiki system for storing knowledge to create a system like atlassian confluence that supports the core features of confluence and recreates a similar user interface for convenience.

### Features

Support for the following features:

1. Spaces (personal, private, public)
2. _Import pages from **Confluence** when creating new space_
3. Permissions for spaces (issuing permissions to users (groups _in progress_) to be able to view / edit / delete or administer a space)
4. Enabling anonymous access (permission to read public spaces)
5. Markdown page editor (with the ability to insert html code or disable rendering html inside markdown global in service)
6. Highlight code blocks on pages
7. Copy / move pages
8. Tree of pages
9. Page updates feed
10. Attachments

## Get started

### Configuration

All configuration may be configured in `appsettings.json` or in Environment variables

#### Authentication

* `Openid:Authority` - openid authority (example: `https://accounts.google.com`)
* `Openid:ClientId` - client id in openid provider 
* `Openid:ClientSecret` - client secret in openid provider 
* `Openid:ResponseType` - oidc authentication response type (example: `code`)
* `Openid:Scope` - array with oidc scope requested when authenticate. By default in index 0,1,2 values ("openid","profile","email") 

#### Database

Mimisbrunnr use MongoDB as persistent data storage.

*  `Storage:ConnectionString` - mongo connection string (example: `mongodb://app:password@localhost/mimisbrunnr?authSource=admin`)

#### Caching

For better responsiveness of the service, caching is used. The service supports several caching modes:
1. In memory - suitable for working in only 1 copy, or for development. (DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS TYPE FOR 2 or more service instances)
2. In MongoDB - does not give a special performance boost, but allows you to cache aggregated data without making many queries each time (for example, the space page tree is quite hard to calculate)
3. In Redis - the most productive and recommended mode.

* `Caching:Type` - cache type (`Memory`, `MongoDb`, `Redis`)
* `Caching:RedisConnectionString` - connection string for Redis cache type

#### Persistent

There are several storage options for storing page attachments and other files: 
1. Local file system - only suitable for deployment in a single instance and not in a docker container
2. GridFS - storing files in MongoDB
3. WebDav - storing files in repositories with webdav interface

* `Persistent:Type` - storage type (`Local`, `GridFs`, `WebDav`)
* Local:
  * `Persistent:Local:Path` - Path in file system where stored files
* GridFs:
  * `Persistent:GridFs:ConnectionString` - MongoDb ConnectionString for gridfs store
* WebDav
  * `Persistent:WebDav:Address` - url to WebDav server (example: `http://nextcloud.local/remote.php/dav/files/sample-username/`)
  * `Persistent:WebDav:Username` - WebDav username
  * `Persistent:WebDav:Password` - WebDav password
